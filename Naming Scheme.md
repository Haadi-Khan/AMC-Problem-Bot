# Naming Scheme

This used to be a comment in the code but was taking up too much space so it's here now.

## AMC + AIME

Naming Scheme Test/Year/Level/Version/Question

For AIMEs, threw in a 10 for the version just so I didn't have to change code, it's easier this way

Also, the I and II of AIME naming was turned into A/B for same reason as before.

**Examples**: AM201810A13 (2018 AMC 10A Problem 13) | AI200210A12 (2002 AIME I Problem 12)


Also quick sidenote as to why there are more AIME years than AMCs:

AIME has had the convention of I and II for longer and this format makes it easier to webscrape due to the link style
being standard. Other AMCs or former AIMEs might be added in the future but for now this is the format

## F=MA
