**I do not claim the rights to this content; the MAA's contest problems are publicly released on the AoPS website, found [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_Problems_and_Solutions). F=MA Problems can be found [here](https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2020/pastexams.cfm)**

Thanks to [Ryan Rudes's AMC Problem Scraper](https://github.com/Ryan-Rudes/amc-problems) for the images folder here.

This is a discord bot for randomly selecting AMC/AIME/F=MA Problems. The major benefit of this bot over others is that it sorts the problems by category which is incredibly helpful for targeted practice. It also allows you to randomly select problems normally.

## Syntax

Generating Random AMC Problem: `?amc {10/12}`

Generating Random AIME Problem: `?aime`

Generating Random F=MA Problem: `?fma`

Generating Random Problem Based on Category:

Easy- `?pce {alg/geo/nt/com}`

Hard- `?pch {alg/geo/nt/com}`

Physics- `pcp {kin/dyn/nrg/col/som/rb/osc/gra/flu/misc}

alg is for algebra, geo is for geometry, nt is for number theory, and com is for combinatorics/probability

kin is for kinematics, dyn is for dynamics, nrg is for energy, col is for collisions, som is for systems of masses, rb is for rigid bodies, osc is for oscillatory motion, flu is for fluids, and misc is dimensional analysis, elasticity, waves, etc.
