Thanks to [Ryan Rudes's AMC Problem Scraper](https://github.com/Ryan-Rudes/amc-problems) for the images folder here.

This is a discord bot for randomly selecting AMC Problems. The major benefit of this bot over others is that it sorts the problems by category which is incredibly helpful for targeted practice. It also allows you to randomly select AMC 10/12 problems normally.

## Syntax

Generating Random Problem: `?pr {10/12}`

Generating Random Problem Based on Category: 

Easy- `?pce {alg/geo/nt/pr}`

Hard- `?pch {alg/geo/nt/pr}`

alg is for algebra, geo is for geometry, nt is for number theory, and pr is for probability
